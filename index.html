            <span id="c0"> Now that we've looked at the architecture
            of the internet, let's see how you might </span>
            <span id="c1" data-anchor="1"> connect your personal devices to
            the internet inside your house.</span>
            <span id="c2"> Well there are many ways to
            connect to the internet, and </span>
            <span id="c3">most often people connect wirelessly.</span><br><br>
            <span>Let's look at an example of how
            you can connect to the internet.</span>
            <span>If you live in a city or a town,
            you probably have a coaxial cable for</span>
            <span>cable Internet, or a phone line if you
            have DSL, running to the outside of</span>
            <span>your house, that connects you to
            the Internet Service Provider, or ISP.</span>
            <span>If you live far out in the country,
            you'll more likely have</span>
            <span>a dish outside your house, connecting
            you wirelessly to your closest ISP, or</span>
            <span>you might also use the telephone system.</span><br><br>
            <span>Whether a wire comes straight from
            the ISP hookup outside your house, or</span>
            <span>it travels over radio
            waves from your roof,</span>
            <span>the first stop a wire will make once
            inside your house, is at your modem.</span>
            <span>A modem is what connects the internet
            to your network at home.</span>
